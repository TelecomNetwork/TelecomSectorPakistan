            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The telecom sector in Pakistan has experienced rapid growth and significant transformation over the past two decades. With the advent of advanced technologies and the liberalization of telecom policies, Pakistan has emerged as one of the most dynamic telecom markets in the region. This article explores the current state, historical context, and future prospects of the telecom sector in Pakistan.</p>

        <section id="historical-context">
            <h2>Historical Context</h2>
            <p>The telecom industry in Pakistan has evolved considerably since the early days of telecommunication. The Pakistan Telecommunication Company Limited (PTCL), established in 1947, was the sole provider of telecom services until the sector was deregulated in 2003. The liberalization policy led to the entry of multiple private operators, fostering competition and innovation. This move not only broke the monopoly of PTCL but also set the stage for rapid technological advancements and a consumer-centric market.</p>
